# SnarkJS Exercise Framework

Welcome to the **SnarkJS Exercises** repository! This repository provides exercises for students to familiarize themselves with the development of zk-SNARKs using **SnarkJS** and **Circom**.

The repo contains everything to develop the exercises. The actual exercise materials are generated as artifacts by a GitHub Actions runner, ready to be given to students.

### Contributing

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests if you have suggestions or find bugs. Contributions are welcome!

Please note that this is a student project and might not be fully polished. We hope it helps in learning zk-SNARKs and zero-knowledge proofs.

### Acknowledgements

- Developed for the "Zero-Knowledge Proofs" course at ETH ZÃ¼rich.
- Thanks to Jonathan Bootle for his feedback and support.

We hope this framework helps you get started with **SnarkJS** and **Circom** in your exploration of zero-knowledge proofs.

Happy learning! ðŸš€
